        The St Pancras Station and Midland Grand Hotel were built in the late 1860s into the early 70s at a time when rail 
        travel was booming in the UK and London became home to 12 such train station hotel amalgams. Rail companies struggled 
        to keep up with demand of the time and the hotel's attached to the various train platforms for the passengers were 
        part of how the companies vied for business. The Midland Grand Hotel aimed to be the largest and most opulent in London, 
        and while it reached that goal it proved to be an unsustainable one. While the station is still active, the hotel sits 
        empty, too unwieldy to open for business.

        The station and hotel themselves ended up as a large scale collage with the industrial train shed, engineered by William 
        Henry Barlow, juxtaposed against the large neo gothic building for the hotel, designed by George Gilbert Scott.
