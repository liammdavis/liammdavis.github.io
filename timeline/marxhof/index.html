        Karl Marx Hof was part of a larger plan to make central Vienna a more hospitable place for the proletariat, 
        and at the same time, dismantle capitalism brick by brick. It was a mid-rise block of flats built in Vienna 
        during Austro-Marxist governance. The building contributed 1600 apartments to a building program that erected
        64,000 apartments in less than 10 years, and housed 250,000 people. All of this intensive construction was 
        subsidized by taxes on the rich, particularly landlords. 
        <br>
        Karl Marx Hof was an example of deviation from traditional urban building design. Its novel approach created 
        a hierarchy of spaces, where one would enter from the public space outside on the street, to the semi public 
        courtyard, then the communal facilities, such as kindergartens, libraries, etc. Finally there was the private 
        space of the apartments. The buildings were part residential, part institutional, and part commercial, 
        simultaneously. They ideally changed day to day life for the better.
