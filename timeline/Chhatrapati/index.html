        Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, originally known as Victoria Terminus, was the largest British colonial building
        in India at the time of its construction. It was built in the aftermath of an 1857 revolt that occurred across
        British occupied India, and its gothic revival styling was intended to re-establish a sense of British
        superiority in their colony. Its design is reminiscent of St. Pancras Station in London, however with
        significant influence from the country it was built in, since it was constructed in India by Indian people
        for that climate and with techniques and materials native to the region.
