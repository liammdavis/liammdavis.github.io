        Now serving more passengers than any other metro system in the world, at 9 million on weekdays, the Moscow 
        Metroâ€™s first stations opened in 1935 after four years of construction. The Soviets brought on designers 
        who had worked on the London Underground, but built the system themselves. 
        <br>
        Expansion in the following years was tumultuous. WWII became a higher priority, than expanding the network, 
        some stations were closed and many became air-raid shelters when necessary. The Cold War also brought with it 
        decreased funding for the trains, but new stations were constructed. The metro system is continuing to expand 
        to this day.
