        The Lovell House was designed by Richard Neutra, and for its innovative approach to modern residential 
        construction, it is part of what put him on the map. Neutra looked to other architects, specifically 
        Le Courbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright, and with the Lovell House charted a course between them. Specifically 
        Corbusier's streamlined aesthetic, and Wright’s planar devices. 

        The Lovell House is also likely the first steel framed residential house in the United States. A technique 
        that was used in Skyscrapers beginning in the late 1800’s, and that Neutra became familiar with while working 
        in Chicago and New York. The home also employed one of the first uses of gunite, where a concrete mixture was 
        sprayed onto the facade of the building.
