        Designed for the family wishing to settle down in the sprawling American suburb, the Lustron Home was an 
        all steel, porcelain enameled house that was intended to be the future. Post-war America was experiencing 
        a housing shortage due to wartime constraints, and there was a lot of government money and support for 
        home building. Carl G. Strundland secured an initial 12.5 million dollar loan from the government to open 
        the Lustron factory in Ohio. However, due to a confluence of errors the corporation shuttered after only 2 
        years. They had hoped to build 45,000 homes in the first two years of operation, but only around 2500 were 
        built. The company ceased production in 1950.
