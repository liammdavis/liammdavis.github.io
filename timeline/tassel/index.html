        This home is an unfortunately beautiful monument to Belgian atrocities in the Congo. Victor Horta’s 
        Hotel Tassel was commissioned by Émile Tassel and it is a precursor to the Art Nouveau movement. 
        It was a culmination of Horta’s big ideas, including exposing the iron structure of the building, 
        integrating the decoration into the structure, fluidity in the building, natural light, and a central 
        greenhouse. Additionally it was Horta’s intent that the home be a reflection of the occupant. While 
        construction was completed in 1894, Horta spent several more years working on furniture for the home.
