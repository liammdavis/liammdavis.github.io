        Widely known for his philanthropic giving, George Peabody spurred the construction of a new library in Baltimore 
        in his name with a $300,000 donation. The building opened after three years of construction but was not dedicated 
        until 1866. Dedication of the building was made challenging by the Civil War, which 
        was taking place around the time of the building's construction. The building, and especially the interior, 
        is renowned for its beauty and was designed by Edmund George Lind.
