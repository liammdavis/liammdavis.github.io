        In 1855 or 56, Llewellyn S. Haskell purchased a plot of land about half the size of central park, 
        14 miles away from it in the New Jersey forest. While Haskellâ€™s investment puzzled many at the time, 
        he proved to be successful and the 400 odd acres of forest became what may be the first of many planned 
        residential communities. The development was lauded in the New York Times in the mid 1860s, after 90 odd 
        homes had been built, for the individual privacy and seclusion offered just a dozen or so miles from 
        Manhattan and behind a gate.
