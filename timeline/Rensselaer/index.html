        The Rensselaer Iron Works was the first steel mill in the US that utilized the patented Bessemer 
        process for manufacturing the material. It was financed by John F. Winslow, a ironmaster and businessman, 
        and John A. Griswold, a banker. Both of them were from Troy, NY, which is where the mill would be located. 
        Alexander L. Holley was the man who spearheaded the process, traveling to Europe to learn Bessemer’s process 
        and pay him for the license. Holley led the design on the Troy mill, which would diverge a great deal from 
        Bessemer’s plans. Holley would go on to design 12 more Bessemer Process mills in the US, focusing more on 
        quantity than quality in the steel making process.
