        The demarcating line, the first building, where skyscrapers transitioned from using their walls to bear their 
        load to using their internal skeleton is hazy at best. From what I have been able to gather, the Reliance 
        Building in Chicago is perhaps the first skyscraper to solely rely on its steel skeleton. What is also important 
        to me about the reliance building in this conversation is the aesthetic of its facade. It does away with a 
        hierarchy on its face, and plate glass windows make up two thirds of its exterior walls. 

        The Surety building in New York City was built around the same time, 1894-96, but it seems construction was 
        completed on the Reliance Building first.  The precursors to this curtain wall construction method, but 
        which did not entirely give up their load bearing walls, include:
