        People had lived on the site where the city and steel mill of Magnitorsk was built since the mid 1700s, but 
        it wasnâ€™t until the late 1920s that the population, and steel production exploded. The area was made central 
        to the first Bolshevik 5 year plan, and thousands of workers, forced laborers chief among them, were poured 
        into the region to build the mill, and the town to accompany it. The resulting plant was allegedly based on the 
        US Steel plant in Gary Indianna, and it was designed by an American company, Arthur Mckee & Co.

        The Soviets looked abroad for the Urban planning of the city as well, bringing on the German architect Ernst May. 
        While the intentions were for a highly planned socialist city designed by the notable architect, the execution 
        was erratic at best, with May designing and building parts of the city, rickety braracks springing up here and 
        there, and few resources to go around. In spite of it all parts of the city that were built later, across the 
        river from the plant did get closer to the stated goals.
