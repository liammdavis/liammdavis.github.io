        While Paris was struggling with a booming population, and before Napoleon and Haussmann began 
        dealing with what felt to them like an urban disaster, Barcelona was contending with more existential 
        urban issues. The city was outgrowing its walls, its population density was more than double that of 
        Paris, and buildings were packed so densely that some of the streets were barely ten feet wide. Disease 
        was rampant, and life expectancy was cratering. Born from this chaos was more or less the discipline of 
        urban planning. As the city began to overflow its walls, a man named Idefons Cerdà began researching and 
        planning a new organizational structure for the city, coining the term “urbanisation.” Unsurprisingly 
        contentious in his time, the Eixample district in Barcelona was constructed with many of the tenants he 
        pioneered, and his work remains influential.
