          During the 17 year period from 1853 to 1857 the city of the urban fabric of Paris underwent a tremendous and controversial alteration,
         spurred by Louis-Napoleon bonaparte and helmed by Georges-Eug√®ne Haussmann. Napoleon arrived in Paris after more than
          a decade in exile and seemed to feel dismayed at the state of the city; it was overcrowded, dirty, and dangerous. 
          His mandate was for light, air, clean water, and sanitation. These citywide renovations conducted by Haussmann 
          included a complex network of sewers known as les egouts, as well as reservoirs and aqueducts that brought clean 
          water into the city.

          The more visible and double-edged construction projects were the grand boulevards that cut 
          through the heart of the city's oldest and densest neighborhoods. This had the dual effect of bringing light and 
          air into the city, while also controlling the population through displacement and making it harder for the poorest 
          Parisians to organize themselves.
