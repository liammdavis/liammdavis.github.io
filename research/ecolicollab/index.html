            This was an exercise in collaboration by me and HB101-pBRKan+pDept E. coli 
            bacteria. I handed off a 2 dimensional drawing of a nightstand that I 
            designed. The bacteria grew and expanded upon the lines that I gave. Then 
            I took the resulting shape, and reinterpreted it back into a 3d design that 
            could theoretically be fabricated. Not all of the joinery has been worked out.

            <br></br>

            A technical drawing of the new nightstand which
            resulted from the collaboration was made at 1:1 scale to illustrate the concept.
