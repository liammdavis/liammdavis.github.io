<p>Custom made tool for cutting coral frag plug sockets into an HDU foam mold. Essentially pockets
  where coral fragments can be glued in to give the artifical reef a headstart. This geometry wasnâ€™t
  possible to cut with the CNC router because it was an undercut. Made from heat treated tooling
  epoxy, cast in a rubber urethane mold.
