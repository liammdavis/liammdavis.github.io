       <div class="about">
          <p class="body">At the tail end of the 19th century, the advent of steel was allowing for the construction of ever 
            taller buildings. The technology to produce this material at this time was not yet sophisticated enough to make 
            monolithic structural columns. This issue was addressed by riveting together less complex shapes in order to make
             the profile that could bear the requisite load.
          <br></br>
          This project builds upon that work by imagining infinitely complex columns for theoretical structures. A relatively 
          simple algorithm takes steel profiles as an input and randomly aggregates them, before mirroring to create a symmetrical 
          column profile. 
        <br></br>
        This algorithm was written in Grasshopper for Rhino and utilized the <a href="https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/wasp">Wasp</a> plugin.

            These speculations were plotted with a modified 3d printer, to create plan drawings. 

            The frame is made of ash, a species that is being wiped out by the invasive emerald ash borer, and was built to display 
            the plan in its correct orientation.

            The <a href="/research/lightprinter">RapLum lightprinter</a> was also used to 
            create a light column.
