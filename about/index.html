			<h2 class="body">About</h2>
				<p class="body">Liam Davis was born in Flagstaff Arizona and grew up in Eugene Oregon. He currently 
					lives, and works in Baltimore Maryland, building furniture, and studying Interdisciplinary Sculpture at 
					Maryland Institute College of Art. 
		    <br></br>
			His work lives alongside us, in our homes. The objects keep us company as we move forward, and quietly remind us about 
			the interconnectedness of things. He is materialistic, because fundamentally everything is matter. He is interested in 
			traveling through time to find new, and importantly better, ways of doings things.
