			<h2 class="body">About</h2>
				<p class="body">Liam Davis was born in Flagstaff AZ and grew up in Eugene OR. Currently he lives in Baltimore MD
				where he is studying interdisciplinary sculpture at Maryland Institute College of Art.
		    <br></br>
			He is curious about the distance, or lack thereof, between what is alive and not alive. His work embodies this through the
			 construction/fabrication of abstracted household objects and spaces. Primarily in metal, wood, and stone.
