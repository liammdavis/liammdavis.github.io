				<p class="body">
					Liam Davis is a sculptor and photographer born in Flagstaff Arizona. 
					He grew up in Eugene Oregon, where he learned to bake bread, and built 
					a wood fired oven. He now lives in Baltimore Maryland, pursuing a BFA 
					in Interdisciplinary Sculpture with a minor in Photography at 
					Maryland Institute College of Art (expected 2025). He currently works making 
					furniture for Crump and Kwash in Hampden.

					He has worked as a research assistant making coral habitat in MICAâ€™s 
					Biofabrication Lab. He has participated in group exhibitions 
					including, Something Big, Gently We Exist, and the MICA Juried 
					Undergraduate Exhibition. He co-curated a show, If Birds Could Fly: 
					On Speculative Futurisms, which was a collective dream about symbiotic 
					progress; an expansive observant, and liberatory future.
			<br></br>
					He is captivated by the way small parts can come together 
					to form a greater whole.
