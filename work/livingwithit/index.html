      <p class="body">

Between the late 19th and mid-20th centuries, American landscape photographers worked to make the vast
continent comprehensible by proliferating the ideology of Manifest Destiny with 8x10-inch sheets of film. They
compressed the sublime into legible, portable images, which transformed the landscape into something
collectible, displayable, and ultimately controllable.
<br>
Davis inverts this historical gesture.
<br>
In these compositions, rocks collected from both the Eastern and Western United States are placed atop scans
of large format, 4x5-inch, sheet film—film that records photographs of interior walls. Through an exaggerated
rescaling of the smallest natural elements, the work returns the landscape to the home, not as a site of
conquest, but as a main character meant for coexistence.
<br>
Within this counter-landscape, geography is not subdued—it is lived.
