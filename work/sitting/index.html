	<p class="body"> These used and unused toothpaste soaps sitting on their tiled pedestal distill my feelings and associations with bathrooms.
		I hope that through this abstraction of those spaces from my past a viewer's own memories and associations with those spaces from their
		past will surface. The used soap, and the hair adorning it, contrasts its unused partner, they attempt to bring forth those associations
		in a visceral manner, while the tiled pedestal more calmly connotes bathrooms.</p>
